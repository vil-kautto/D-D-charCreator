# D&D character creator (Ongoing development)

This program is used to generate a random character for dungeons & dragons game, written wholly in python

The project was created in order to speed up character creation process for one-shot style games, where players don't need to invest so much into their characters

The project also serves as an exercise in python's gui libraries

The generated character data can also be extracted in cvs format.
