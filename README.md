# D&D character creator (Ongoing development)

### About

This program is used to generate a random character for dungeons & dragons game, written wholly in python

The project was created in order to speed up character creation process for one-shot style games, where players don't need to invest so much into their characters.

**This program heavily relies upon pseudorandom number generation**

All data related to character creation is from [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/). You can find more about D&D and it's details from the website.

### Determining attributes

The program uses a standard procedure for stat generation:

`4d6 - the smallest roll`

This gives the generated character a start with attributes between 3-18, with a small weight towards the larger numbers.

*Note: the attributes can be larger than 18 via racial bonuses.*

### Features

Currently the program has the following features:

- Character details:
  - Class traits
  - Attributes
  - Starting items (bags, tools, etc.)
  - Starting equipment
  - Races, Racial attributes and abilities

Yet to be added for 1.0, the MVP release:

- Character details
  - Random gold amount for each character

Nice to haves and potential development ideas:

- Make a GUI for the application
- Add random name generation based on race
- Add spell and trait details

### Usage

Clone the latest version and run start.bat, can't really get simpler than that

## Development environment

To start the development of this program, simply clone the repository and start modifying the code via your favorite text editor or IDE for python.

Notes:

The src -directory contains all the code related to the application

The data folder is created when the application is run for the first time and it contains all the data generated by the application
